* Week starting <2020-12-21 Mon>
** <2021-01-05 Tue> - fix lantern-photogrammetry; review video-gen; ADK005 processing
*** TODO branch bedrock and integrate metashape-cli for 1.6.5 compatibility
*** DONE email zdzislaw to tee up a time for review
*** TODO look into adk005 processing
Look at the datasets, read Jordan's notes

** <2021-01-06 Wed> - finish lantern-photogrammetry fix; ADK005 testing
*** DONE finish fixing lantern-photogrammetry
This will involve fixing metashape-cli, as we are still getting /RuntimeError: not enough cameras/
-> caused by not appending .psx for metashape-cli process
*** TODO test reconstruction with 3 links at a time
There should be some processed data on Pond, start there.
- seqview was down! Took some work to make a local instance
- got up to labelling, will talk to asif tomorrow
*** TODO set up local seqview instance
- add prefs folder in root directory of seqview
** <2021-01-07 Thu> - ADK005 testing
*** DONE fix directory structure
*** DONE generate seqview data for mooring line 1
** <2021-01-07 Thu> - ADK005 testing; investigate thing for Fraser
*** TODO create or update masking SOP
*** TODO investigate thing for Fraser
*** TODO mask revolutions separately in V7
- Lots of bash loops! I should save these commands I'm using...
- While it's a bit tedious keeping everything in order, it should be easy enough to separate the work out.
- Definitely a big job uploading data to V7 like this
  - It would be nice if uploads from command line preserved folders
**** TODO rename to adk005.mooring-line-1, as we will put all the links in this project
*** TODO generate imagery with darktable filter
*** DONE investigate reconstruction without masks
Not good :(
