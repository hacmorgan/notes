* Longer term TODOs
** TODO basic-metashape: add --list-export-filetypes (for mesh and pointcloud)
** TODO lantern-photogrammetry: autoset seqview to Camera On Demand
** TODO lantern-photogrammetry: remove need for --force when using --dry-run

* Week starting <2020-11-30 Mon>
Projects this week:
- CHEV002: Data processing

** <2020-11-30 Mon> - CHEV002: Point cloud generation and cleaning
   *CHEV002* 
*** DONE Meet with Asif to discuss next steps
He will clean K-node then start with Polyworks.
*** DONE /work-basket.standoff.01/: realign cameras and rebuild dense cloud
- This fixed the bad alignment issue
- There are small patches of bad reconstruction at the top, but otherwise it seems quite good
*** DONE /stairway.cvi.01/: realign cameras and rebuild dense cloud
The stairway CVI dataset did not reconstruct properly, even with sequential matching.
*** DONE /stairway.standoff.02/: align cameras
This is a better reconstruction then the CVI dataset, but it still isn't perfect.
*** DONE /stairway.cvi-standoff-combined/: aggregate logs
No reconstruction performed, not yet sure if we will use this.


** <2020-12-01 Tue> - CHEV002: Point cloud cleaning and investigating better alignment
   *CHEV002*
*** TODO Work basket: assess difference in quality when using colour balanced images
**** DONE Move images to /images-original/, and make directory /images-balanced/ for colour balanced images
**** DONE Colour balance images
**** TODO Duplicate chunk, realign images, and regenerate dense cloud
**** TODO Compare to other chunk
*** TODO Work basket: finish cleaning model, determine if it is of acceptable quality
*** DONE K-node: check that full coverage has been achieved (it has)
*** TODO continue cleaning k-node
finally it is clean. There is actually some ghosting, but it is minor. The mesh looks quite good.
*** *Problems*
- Lack of metashape licenses (hard to work in parallel)
- Broken API (metashape-cli would fix this)

** <2020-12-02 Wed> - CHEV002: more pointcloud cleaning
*** TODO daheng-air: improve colour balance filter params
*** DONE K-node: clean pointcloud further
*** DONE K-node: run texture generation on further cleaned pointcloud
*** DONE K-node: export dense cloud and texture for Asif
*** TODO K-node: aggregate standoff and cvi, run full pipeline, investigate quality
*** K-node: run alignment with colour balanced images
