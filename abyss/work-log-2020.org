* Week starting <2020-11-30 Mon>
Projects this week:
- CHEV002: Data processing

** <2020-11-30 Mon> - CHEV002: Point cloud generation and cleaning
   *CHEV002* 
*** DONE Meet with Asif to discuss next steps
He will clean K-node then start with Polyworks.
*** DONE /work-basket.standoff.01/: realign cameras and rebuild dense cloud
- This fixed the bad alignment issue
- There are small patches of bad reconstruction at the top, but otherwise it seems quite good
*** DONE /stairway.cvi.01/: realign cameras and rebuild dense cloud
The stairway CVI dataset did not reconstruct properly, even with sequential matching.
*** DONE /stairway.standoff.02/: align cameras
This is a better reconstruction then the CVI dataset, but it still isn't perfect.
*** DONE /stairway.cvi-standoff-combined/: aggregate logs
No reconstruction performed, not yet sure if we will use this.


** <2020-12-01 Tue> - CHEV002: Point cloud cleaning and investigating better alignment
   *CHEV002*
*** TODO Work basket: assess difference in quality when using colour balanced images
**** DONE Move images to /images-original/, and make directory /images-balanced/ for colour balanced images
**** DONE Colour balance images
**** TODO Duplicate chunk, realign images, and regenerate dense cloud
**** TODO Compare to other chunk
*** TODO Work basket: finish cleaning model, determine if it is of acceptable quality
*** DONE K-node: check that full coverage has been achieved (it has)
*** TODO continue cleaning k-node
finally it is clean. There is actually some ghosting, but it is minor. The mesh looks quite good.
*** *Problems*
- Lack of metashape licenses (hard to work in parallel)
- Broken API (metashape-cli would fix this)

** <2020-12-02 Wed> - CHEV002: more pointcloud cleaning
*** TODO daheng-air: improve colour balance filter params
*** DONE K-node: clean pointcloud further
*** DONE K-node: run texture generation on further cleaned pointcloud
*** DONE K-node: export dense cloud and texture for Asif
*** TODO K-node: aggregate standoff and cvi, run full pipeline, investigate quality
*** K-node: run alignment with colour balanced images
  
    
* Week starting <2020-12-07 Mon>
Projects this week:
- CHEV002: Data processing

** <2020-12-07 Mon> - CHEV002: Point cloud quantification, improving model quality for older models
*** Point cloud corrosion quantification
counting number of coloured points
*** improving model quality
Work basket models aren't yet perfect, tried auto-balancing images and running that through metashape
  - alignment is really good

** <2020-12-08 Tue> - CHEV002: Reporting
*** DONE Review report by Asif
*** DONE Crop transport from colour-mapped mesh
*** TODO migrate to gentoo
**** DONE push notes.git
**** TODO build cloudcompare
**** TODO build comma and snark
**** DONE install & set up wireguard
**** DONE install metashape & metashape pro
** <2020-12-09 Wed> - CHEV002: Working on next models
*** DONE Clean colour balanced work basket
*** DONE build texture for work basket
*** DONE Improving daheng-air filter
current best: 0.5,0.5,1.5
*** TODO run k-node with colour balanced imagery
*** DONE run stairway with aggregated imagery
This appears to have created a better quality reconstruction, not sure if it's perfect though.
** <2020-12-10 Thu> - CHEV002: working on better alignment
*** TODO generate high quality stairway model
This worked okay, but it would be nice to try with auto-balanced images
**** TODO Try aligning sequentially
**** TODO Try increased priority ratio
**** DONE Try aligning auto-balanced imagery
*** DONE hand work basket model to Asif
**** DONE Export decimated mesh first
*** TODO organise calendar event to review platypus-explorer-calc
**** TODO refamiliarise first
*** DONE Investigate difficulty of transitioning to metashape-cli
**** TODO email Jordan if feasible
*** DONE email Toby
*** DONE email Chris
** <2020-12-11 Fri> - CHEV002: Stairway model, get the ball rolling on SW2
*** TODO organise calendar event to review platypus-explorer-calc
**** TODO refamiliarise first
*** TODO email Seva about comma utils and metashape-cli
*** DONE finish metashape-cli
*** TODO generate high quality stairway model
This worked okay, but it would be nice to try with auto-balanced images
**** DONE Try aligning sequentially
**** DONE Try increased priority ratio
**** DONE Try aligning auto-balanced imagery
Didn't work


* Week starting <2020-12-14 Mon>
** <2020-12-14 Mon> - CHEV002: finalise stairway model; SW2: start on video gen
*** TODO produce a respectable stairway model
None of the methods so far have worked, so we may need to combine them. At this stage it is most important to get a good alignment.
**** TODO Try auto-balancing the 30% standoff model and realigning that
*** TODO review image-stream-merge stuff
*** TODO annotate links
*** TODO export decimated model for asif
*** TODO change bluerobotics-ping-sonar-to-csv to lt
*** TODO play with platypus data
*** TODO make model of only top of stairway
** <2020-12-15 Tue> - CHEV002: stairway; SW2: video-gen; ADK005: masking
*** TODO stairway model
**** DONE sequential alignment
FAIL
**** TODO Take only the top section 
use the /other/ annotation category to just take the top
** <2020-12-16 Wed> - CHEV002: stairway; SW2: video-gen
*** stairway model: sequential alignment for top of stairway
*** stairway model: clean best model available
*** platypus-explorer-calc frame-timeline: implement
*** platypus-explorer-calc merge-streams: implement
