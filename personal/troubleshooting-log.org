Record of problems encountered, and how they were solved 

* Gentoo
** Kernel panics during boot, issue with filesystem
The kernel didn't have NVMe support compiled in, this fixed the problems

** Feh places background in the centre of the two monitors
Feh needed to be compiled with xinerama support, so =/etc/portage/package.use/feh= was created with contents:
=media-gfx/feh xinerama=

** Emacs wouldn't open with GUI
had to add =gui= USE flag globally, as well as =gtk= and =xft= specifically to emacs
** cifs (abyss-mount-share) didn't work
*read gentoo wiki!!*
- enable cifs in kernel config
- emerge cifs-utils or samba, including USE flags specified on the wiki
** wacom
- enable wacom in kernel config
- emerge =x11-drivers/xf86-input-wacom= to get xsetwacom
** audio
*** kernel
- ALSA needs to be enabled
- asus xonar driver compiled in
- intel/nvidia driver compiled in
*** userland
- alsa-libs needs to be emerged

** cuda
cuda package was masked by the =~amd64= keyword. You can get around this by placing the below in =/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords=:
#+begin_src config
dev-util/nvidia-cuda-toolkit ~amd64
#+end_src

** cloudcompare couldn't find shared library
=/etc/ld.so.conf= had =/usr/local/lib64= as a directory, which was the location of the shared object file. The solution was to run:
#+begin_src bash
sudo ldconfig
#+end_src


* Comma & snark
** csv-eval =no module named comma=
pomma was not on $PYTHONPATH, but that env variable is not set by default, and setting it doesn't help on Gentoo. This command will show where python looks for modules
#+begin_src python
import sys
for path in sys.path: 
    print(path)
#+end_src

This showed that python looks to =/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages= (among other places), but not =/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages=, so the easiest thing to do was change the =PYTHON_PACKAGE_INSTALL_PREFIX= in ccmake to =/usr= rather than =/usr/local=.

** snark would not build because of missing parts of Boost
This was caused because I didn't use the global USE flags for snark, so it was not compiled with support for threads (among other things)

Naturally, the solution was to include all the USE flags and re-emerge boost
