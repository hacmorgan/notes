This is the canonical reference point for *all* projects, past, present and future.

If the project is big enough that it has its own /notes/ files, this should just be a link to that file.

* System Administration & Utilities
** TODO name-value-args
** TODO proper locationing of configs & cmake install for utilities
This does hinge to a certain extent on the potential for different platforms to share a single master copy of a config, and differ by branching. If symlinks are to be broken, and utilities on PATH are to be moved, this should all happen at once.

With that said, there is also a chance git branches won't work perfectly for this, as they /seem/ to be slightly more specialised for maintaining a code base. For this reason, the git branching thing should be the first thing investigated here.

*** TODO Transition some configs to a branching system to test if suitable
This has been working great, currently leaving the master branch as the desktop config, and having separate branches for everything else.

*** TODO Copy cmake stuff from Bedrock in order to install utilities
    

* Programming Languages
** Rust
*** DONE Rust by example
*** DONE csv-plot
*** TODO Algorithms course
*** TODO Contribute to i3status-rust 
**** TODO Determine if the project is too advanced
*** TODO Contribute to ROSrust


** Linux
*** TODO Linux From Scratch
*** TODO Understanding the Linux Kernel
Do this after LFS, it might make understanding some of its content easier
*** TODO Read through kernel docs
After /Understanding the Linux Kernel/, as it should lay the foundations for
making sense of the more contemporary documentation


** Assembler
*** TODO x86 Assembler tutorial (YouTube)


* Building Stuff
** TODO [[~/src/projects/pelicomputer/plan.org][Pelicomp v1.0]]
** FreeCAD
*** TODO Tutorial
*** TODO Metrology


* Security
** TODO pwnable.kr


* Embedded
** Contemporary
*** RTEMS Quick Start Guide
**** TODO Review email from Chris to determine if can proceed
** Ben Eater Tutorials
*** TODO Hello World on a 6502
Order both this kit and the homemade clock kit too. It would be cool to have an
oscilloscope by then, but not fully necessary.
*** TODO 8-bit computer
Order components
*** TODO homemade video card
**** TODO Watch first few videos to determine if I want to do this

** Pomodoro
- Build a simple pomodoro timer from scratch using either
  - a microprocessor (e.g. 6502), using assembly
  - from scratch like the 8-bit computer.
- Probably need to watch a few more videos before doing this


* Other people's projects
** Tour Calculator


* Completed
** C
*** DONE Work through CK&R


* Abandoned
None, yet.
